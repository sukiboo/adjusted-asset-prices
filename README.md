# adjusted-asset-prices

Adjust raw historical prices for splits and dividends.

Follow-up to the [`historical-asset-prices`](https://github.com/sukiboo/historical-asset-prices) repo,
which produces the raw input files this tool reads from `./data/files/<asset_type>/`.

## Setup

```bash
pyenv virtualenv 3.12 adjusted-asset-prices
pyenv activate adjusted-asset-prices
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The repo's `.python-version` pins the venv, so `cd`-ing in auto-activates it if you have
`pyenv virtualenv-init` in your shell.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py <TICKER> [OPTIONS]
```

End-to-end pipeline for one ticker: load raw bars → backfill missing minutes → adjust for
splits and cash dividends (stocks only, using yfinance metadata) → run sanity checks →
save to `./data/prices/<TICKER>.<format>` → reload and verify the round-trip.

Options:

| flag            | default          | description                                  |
|-----------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `--format`      | `parquet`        | output format: `parquet` or `csv`            |
| `--date-start`  | (earliest)       | inclusive start date, `YYYY-MM-DD`           |
| `--date-end`    | (latest)         | inclusive end date, `YYYY-MM-DD`             |
| `--data-dir`    | `./data/files`   | raw input directory                          |
| `--save-dir`    | `./data/prices`  | adjusted output directory                    |
| `--debug`       | off              | print extra info during load                 |

Examples:

```bash
python main.py BTC-USD --debug
python main.py SPY --format csv --date-start 2024-01-01
```

## Caveats

- **Splits and dividends are sourced from yfinance.** The pipeline trusts
  `yf.Ticker(...).splits`, `.dividends`, and `.history()` for the event list and the
  reference closes used in factor computation. Future events known to yfinance at run
  time are applied universally to historical prices (matching yfinance's `Adj Close`
  convention), so a saved file is a snapshot — re-run if new distributions are announced
  after the fact. Options inherit split metadata at the contract level and are not
  back-adjusted here; non-stock asset types are passed through as-is.
- **Options pipeline is partially complete.** Loading, RTH-aware backfilling
  (`[09:30, 15:59]` ET via NYSE calendar), and the correct skip of split/dividend
  adjustment (options are contract-adjusted by the OCC, not price-adjusted) all work.
  However, the quality-check gate (`compare_to_yf`) has no usable data source for
  individual OSI contracts — yfinance only exposes current option chains, not historical
  per-contract time series — so `python main.py <option_ticker>` will currently fail at
  the check step and not save. Remaining work: parse the OSI symbol to enable expiry
  pruning at load time and replace the yfinance gate with a structural bounds check
  (price ≥ 0, calls ≤ underlying, puts ≤ strike, no bars after expiry). Also note that
  index/ETF options with extended 16:15 ET close (SPX, SPXW, SPY, QQQ, IWM, ...) have
  their 16:00-16:14 ET bars dropped on reindex by design — `[09:30, 15:59]` is correct
  for vanilla equity contracts and trades cleanness for those at the cost of partial
  data for the extended-close products.
- **Stocks** include extended-hours bars (`[04:00, 19:59]` ET via NYSE pre/post session
  bounds), matching Polygon's emission exactly.
- **Hard forks are not adjusted for.** When a chain splits (e.g. BCH from BTC, ETC from
  ETH), pre-fork prices of the surviving ticker are technically inflated by the value of
  the spun-off coin, analogously to a stock split. The pipeline does not currently
  account for this — pre-fork bars are passed through as-is. Irrelevant for most majors
  in typical date ranges, but worth knowing if you backtest across a known fork date.
- **Backfilled minutes are synthetic and unmarked.** Missing 1-minute bars are filled
  by log-space linear interpolation between the surrounding real prints; the output
  carries no flag indicating which rows were interpolated vs. observed. For liquid
  majors this is rare and the interpolation is close to truth, but for thin-volume
  assets with long gaps the synthetic values can drift meaningfully from what real
  trades would have produced.

## Testing

End-to-end integration tests in `tests/integration/` run the full pipeline against real
Polygon flat files and live yfinance data — no mocks. Run with:

```bash
pytest -m integration -v -s
```

`-s` disables stdout capture so each test's scenario header, bar counts, price range, and
boundary spot-checks print to the terminal as it runs. Drop `-s` if you want a quieter pass.

Tests skip per-asset when `data/files/<asset>/` is empty, so wire up the data the same way
you would for `main.py` (a symlink to your raw-file mirror works). Current coverage:

- **Stocks**: AAPL 7:1 split, NVDA 4:1 + 10:1 splits with dividends, GE 1:8 reverse split,
  SPY 2020–2023 dividends-only multi-year, QYLD monthly ROC distributions, MSFT 2004 $3.08
  special dividend (~10% drop), BBBY pre-bankruptcy window.
- **Crypto**: BTC-USD Luna/Terra crash (soft-AND gate stress), BTC-USD 2020–2022 multi-year,
  ETH-USD 2021–2022 (Merge + FTX), SOL-USD 2022–2023 (FTX collapse + recovery).
- **Forex**: EUR-USD weekend-crossing week, EUR-USD 2022–2024 multi-year.
- **Options**: not yet covered — the check gate needs a structural replacement first (see
  the options caveat above).

Expect roughly 2–5 minutes per long-running test on first run.

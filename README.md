# [WIP] adjusted-asset-prices

Adjust raw historical prices for splits (and optionally dividends), with an opt-in options pass.

Follow-up to the [`historical-asset-prices`](https://github.com/sukiboo/historical-asset-prices) repo,
which produces the raw input files this tool reads from `./data/files/<asset_type>/`.

## Scope

Built for **multi-year price histories** of assets where long histories are hard to source
elsewhere. Accuracy is calibrated for long horizons; short windows can show small
divergences from yfinance's daily Close, because yfinance's snapshot doesn't precisely
line up with our 1-min UTC bars (an offset of a couple of hours of FX market state for
forex, fractions of a minute for crypto). That noise averages out across many days but
can dominate a 5-day sample on a single high-volatility day — a BoJ intervention, a
tariff-day spike, an exchange collapse. If you need a week of data, other providers serve
it more easily; the value here is in multi-year histories you can't get cleanly elsewhere.

## Setup

```bash
pyenv virtualenv 3.12 adjusted-asset-prices
pyenv activate adjusted-asset-prices
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The repo's `.python-version` pins the venv, so `cd`-ing in auto-activates it if you have
`pyenv virtualenv-init` in your shell.

## Usage

```bash
python run.py <TICKER> [OPTIONS]
```

End-to-end pipeline for one ticker: load raw bars → backfill missing minutes → adjust for
splits (and optionally cash dividends; stocks only, using yfinance metadata) → run sanity
checks → save to `./data/prices/<TICKER>_<start>_<end>.<format>` (the date range is taken
from the saved series' own index) → reload and verify the round-trip.

Options:

| flag            | default          | description                                          |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `--data-dir`    | `./data/files`   | raw input directory                                  |
| `--save-dir`    | `./data/prices`  | adjusted output directory                            |
| `--format`      | `parquet`        | output format: `parquet` or `csv`                    |
| `--date-start`  | (earliest)       | inclusive start date, `YYYY-MM-DD`                   |
| `--date-end`    | (latest)         | inclusive end date, `YYYY-MM-DD`                     |
| `--dividends`   | off              | also back-adjust stocks for cash dividends           |
| `--options`     | off              | also fetch the underlying's option contracts         |
| `--plot`        | off              | display the price-comparison plot against yfinance   |

`--dividends` and `--options` are mutually exclusive: the default output is the actual
split-adjusted (not dividend-adjusted) price, so options align with their underlying.

Examples:

```bash
python run.py BTC-USD
python run.py SPY --dividends --format csv --date-start 2024-01-01
python run.py AAPL --options
```

## Caveats

- **Splits and dividends are sourced from yfinance.** The pipeline trusts
  `yf.Ticker(...).splits`, `.dividends`, and `.history()` for the event list and the
  reference closes used in factor computation. Future events known to yfinance at run
  time are applied universally to historical prices (matching yfinance's `Adj Close`
  convention), so a saved file is a snapshot — re-run if new distributions are announced
  after the fact. Stock splits are applied to options too, at the contract level (OCC-style;
  see below), but options are never dividend-adjusted. Non-stock asset types (crypto, forex)
  are passed through as-is — no splits or dividends.
- **Options are an opt-in companion pass** (`--options`), not a standalone ticker mode: you
  pass an underlying and the pipeline runs its stocks pass first, then loads every OSI
  contract on that underlying, OCC-adjusts them for splits (premium ÷ ratio *and* OSI symbol
  rewrite, including numeric-suffix roots like `AAPL7`), RTH-backfills (last trade held flat;
  `[09:30, 15:59]` ET via the NYSE calendar), validates, and saves. yfinance has no historical
  per-contract series, so the quality gate is a structural no-arb check (price > 0, calls ≤
  underlying, puts ≤ strike, intrinsic floors, no bars past expiry) against the split-only
  underlying. Positivity and expiry are checked on every bar; the no-arb bounds are scored on
  **real (traded), near-the-money bars only** — synthetic backfilled bars hold the last trade
  flat and don't track the underlying between prints, so they'd breach the bounds without any
  arbitrage. `--options` and `--dividends` are mutually exclusive: the gate needs the
  underlying as it actually traded, and dividends are priced into the premium rather than
  back-adjusted out. Spinoff-style corporate actions (where the OCC changes the deliverable,
  not the strike) are skipped. Index/ETF options with an extended 16:15 ET close (SPX, SPXW,
  SPY, QQQ, IWM, ...) have their 16:00–16:14 ET bars dropped on reindex by design —
  `[09:30, 15:59]` is correct for vanilla equity contracts and trades that cleanness for
  partial data on the extended-close products.
- **Stocks** include extended-hours bars (`[04:00, 19:59]` ET via NYSE pre/post session
  bounds), matching Polygon's emission exactly.
- **Hard forks are not adjusted for.** When a chain splits (e.g. BCH from BTC, ETC from
  ETH), pre-fork prices of the surviving ticker are technically inflated by the value of
  the spun-off coin, analogously to a stock split. The pipeline does not currently
  account for this — pre-fork bars are passed through as-is. Irrelevant for most majors
  in typical date ranges, but worth knowing if you backtest across a known fork date.
- **Backfilled minutes are synthetic and (in the saved files) unmarked.** Missing 1-minute
  bars are filled differently by liquidity class, and the saved output carries no flag
  marking observed vs. synthetic rows:
  - **Stocks / crypto / forex** (liquid): log-space linear interpolation between the
    surrounding real prints. The asset really was trading at intermediate values, so a smooth
    multiplicative path is a fair approximation of the true intervening price.
  - **Options** (illiquid): the last traded price is held flat (`ffill`/`bfill`), **not**
    interpolated. Between two option trades — often hours apart — no price discovery happened,
    so carrying the last print forward is the honest "no new information" convention;
    interpolating would fabricate a smooth path that never traded. This also makes the
    interior fill consistent with the run-out to expiry (already a flat hold) and sidesteps
    any log-vs-linear interpolation distortion. The asymmetry with stocks is deliberate, not
    sloppy: liquid assets have a real intervening path worth approximating, illiquid options
    don't. (Internally the options pass *does* mark real vs. synthetic bars, so the no-arb
    quality gate scores only real traded prints; that marker is dropped before saving.)

  For thin-volume assets with long gaps the synthetic values can drift meaningfully from what
  real trades would have produced.

## Testing

End-to-end integration tests in `tests/integration/` run the full pipeline against real
Polygon flat files and live yfinance data — no mocks. Run with:

```bash
pytest -m integration -v -s
```

`-s` disables stdout capture so each test's scenario header, bar counts, price range, and
boundary spot-checks print to the terminal as it runs. Drop `-s` if you want a quieter pass.

Tests skip per-asset when `data/files/<asset>/` is empty, so wire up the data the same way
you would for `run.py` (a symlink to your raw-file mirror works). Current coverage:

- **Stocks**: AAPL 7:1 split (split-only path), AAPL 2023 split-only-vs-dividend-adjusted
  both-ways (convention switch), NVDA 4:1 + 10:1 splits with dividends, GE 1:8 reverse split,
  SPY 2020–2023 dividends multi-year, QYLD monthly ROC distributions, MSFT 2004 $3.08 special
  dividend (~10% drop), BBBY pre-bankruptcy window.
- **Crypto**: BTC-USD Luna/Terra crash (crypto-threshold stress), BTC-USD 2020–2022 multi-year,
  ETH-USD 2021–2022 (Merge + FTX), SOL-USD 2022–2023 (FTX collapse + recovery).
- **Forex**: EUR-USD weekend-crossing week, EUR-USD 2022–2024 multi-year.
- **Options**: NVDA 10:1 2024 (clean-strike unification), AAPL 7:1 2014 (non-clean /
  suffixed-root unification), TSLA 3:1 2022 (clean integer ratio), AAPL 2023 no-split
  (clean-window structural gate), NVDA 4:1 2021 and TSLA 5:1 2020 (cumulative forward
  multi-split, ÷40 / ÷15), GRPN 1:20 2020 and VXX two-1:4 (reverse and cumulative-reverse
  splits, ×20 / ×16). Forward splits — and GRPN's reverse split — validate via the structural
  no-arb gate (`check_options`) against the split-only underlying, since yfinance has no
  historical per-contract series. Forward splits also check split-successor **continuity** on a
  *deep-ITM* probe contract (real-trade close before vs after the split, within ~10%): deep-ITM is
  low-elasticity so the ratio reflects the adjustment rather than gamma, and real-trade endpoints
  avoid the ffill artifact that makes fixed-time bars vacuously ~1. Reverse splits get **no
  continuity probe** (thin/volatile names have no deep-ITM contract that traded both sides — only
  ATM/OTM, which swing wildly on gamma); they verify the cumulative back-adjustment **factor**
  instead (×20 / ×16). VXX additionally **skips the gate**: as a steep-contango vol ETP its forward
  sits far below spot, so ITM calls legitimately trade below the spot-based intrinsic floor on real
  near-the-money bars — a genuine carry effect the gate can't model, independent of split
  correctness. (GRPN's old gate failure was synthetic/deep-ITM noise, which the gate now excludes
  by scoring real traded bars only — so it passes.)

Expect roughly 2–5 minutes per long-running test on first run.

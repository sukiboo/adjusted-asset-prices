# --- Reverse splits ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# the structural gate: reverse splits only happen on assets the gate's spot-based intrinsic
# floor can't handle, and a full survey of all 6008 option underlyings found no exception.
#   - penny stocks (the vast majority; the actual pre-split price is ~$1-3): tick granularity +
#     stale illiquid prints, amplified by the ×k multiplier, push the floor p99 well past 5%.
#   - vol/leveraged ETPs (VXX, UVXY, USO, BOIL, ...): steep roll-decay carry drags the forward
#     far below spot, so ITM CALLS legitimately trade below S-K — the floor is the wrong bound.
#   - high-yield mortgage REITs (CIM, ARR): dividend carry, same one-sided call breach.
#   - confounded names (GE: GEHC/Vernova spinoffs divide the underlying but not the options;
#     AMC: simultaneous APE conversion breaks continuity).
# In every tested case the split ADJUSTMENT is correct (continuity = 1.0); only the gate's
# large-cap-tuned floor rejects them, for reasons unrelated to splits.
